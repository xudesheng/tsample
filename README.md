# tsample

This purpose of this tool is to provide performance metrics for Thingworx.

**Caution**: wherever you need an AppKey, this tool will use Oauth for authentication if the AppKey format is like: `"Bearer [AUTH_TOKEN]"`. Otherwise, it will use AppKey for authentication.

From the version `v4.0.0`, this tool will not support to export the OS level metrics. Instead, it can support the export of the following metrics:

1. Thingworx Subsystems
2. Thingworx Connection Server
3. JMX C3P0 metrics (you need to install the specific extension first.)
4. Persistent Property metrics (you need to install the specifc extension first.)

- reaching out to PTC TS or your service provider to get the extensions.
